# SQL Playground Development Plan

Based on the NYC Taxi Interview Questions and our existing 12-month dataset.

## üéØ Phase 1: Star Schema Implementation (Question 2 inspired)

**Transform existing normalized schema into dimensional model:**

### Fact Table: `fact_taxi_trips`
- Trip-level metrics (distance, fare amounts, passenger count)
- Foreign keys to all dimension tables
- Measures for analytics

### Dimension Tables:
- **`dim_date`**: Full date hierarchy (year, quarter, month, week, day, holidays)
- **`dim_time`**: Hour-level time dimensions (rush hour flags, business hours)
- **`dim_locations`**: Enhanced with borough, zone type, airport flags
- **`dim_vendor`**: Vendor information with performance metrics
- **`dim_payment_type`**: Payment methods with processing flags
- **`dim_rate_code`**: Rate types with zone applicability

### Benefits:
- Faster analytical queries
- Pre-calculated aggregations via materialized views
- Business-friendly dimension hierarchies

## üöÄ Phase 2: System Architecture & Partitioning (Questions 13-15 inspired)

### Partitioning implementation:
1. **Automated monthly partitioning** with maintenance procedures
2. **Partition pruning** optimization
3. **Cross-partition query** optimization
4. **Partition-wise joins** for performance

### Foundation for scalability:
1. **Partition elimination** strategies
2. **Automated partition maintenance** procedures
3. **Constraint exclusion** optimization
4. **Parallel query execution** across partitions

## ‚ö° Phase 3: Performance & Optimization Features (Questions 5-6 inspired)

### Advanced indexing strategy (building on partitioning):
1. **Partition-local indexes** for optimal performance
2. **Partial indexes** for data quality (valid trips only)
3. **Covering indexes** with INCLUDE clauses for common queries
4. **Expression indexes** for time-based patterns (hour extraction, date functions)

### Query optimization showcase:
1. **Before/After examples** showing performance improvements
2. **Execution plan analysis** tools with partition pruning
3. **Index usage monitoring** queries across partitions
4. **Partition-aware query patterns**

## üìä Phase 4: Advanced Analytics Capabilities (Questions 7-8 inspired)

### Window function showcases:
1. **Top N analysis** (profitable zones per borough)
2. **Time series analysis** with rolling averages
3. **Anomaly detection** using statistical methods
4. **Year-over-year comparisons** and trend analysis

### Business intelligence features:
1. **Revenue dashboards** by multiple dimensions
2. **Seasonal pattern analysis**
3. **Cross-borough flow analysis**
4. **Peak hour optimization insights**

## üåç Phase 5: Geospatial Analytics (Questions 9-10 inspired)

### PostGIS advanced features:
1. **Airport proximity analysis** (zones within 1 mile of airports)
2. **Heat map generation** using grid-based analysis
3. **Route optimization** algorithms
4. **Geographic clustering** of high-activity areas

### Spatial performance:
1. **Spatial indexes** optimization
2. **Geometry simplification** for performance
3. **Distance calculation** optimization techniques

## üîç Phase 6: Data Quality & Monitoring (Questions 11-12 inspired)

### Comprehensive data quality framework:
1. **Automated quality checks** with thresholds and alerts
2. **Data cleaning procedures** with business rule applications
3. **Quality score calculations** and trending
4. **Anomaly detection** for operational monitoring

### Monitoring dashboard:
1. **Real-time quality metrics**
2. **Performance monitoring** (query times, index usage)
3. **Data volume tracking** and trend analysis
4. **Alert system** for quality degradation

## üéì Phase 7: Educational & Interview Features

### Interactive learning modules:
1. **Step-by-step tutorials** for each advanced SQL concept
2. **Performance comparison** tools
3. **Query playground** with real-time execution plans
4. **Interview question** practice environment

### Documentation and examples:
1. **Complete query library** from the interview questions
2. **Performance benchmarking** results
3. **Best practices** documentation
4. **Architecture decision** records

## Implementation Strategy

This plan transforms our current basic schema into a production-grade analytical platform that demonstrates advanced SQL concepts, performance optimization, and real-world data engineering practices - all using the existing 12 months of NYC taxi data.

### Current Foundation:
- ‚úÖ 12 months of NYC taxi data (40+ million records)
- ‚úÖ PostGIS spatial extensions enabled
- ‚úÖ Basic normalized schema with lookup tables
- ‚úÖ Automated data loading pipeline
- ‚úÖ Docker-based deployment

### Next Steps:
1. Start with Phase 1 (Star Schema) to establish dimensional foundation
2. Implement Phase 2 (Partitioning) to create scalable architecture foundation
3. Build Phase 3 (Performance & Indexing) leveraging partition structure
4. Add Phase 4 (Analytics) for advanced query demonstrations
5. Implement Phase 5 (Geospatial) for PostGIS showcases
6. Build Phase 6 (Quality) for operational excellence
7. Complete with Phase 7 (Education) for learning platform

Each phase builds upon the interview questions' concepts, creating a comprehensive SQL learning and demonstration environment.
