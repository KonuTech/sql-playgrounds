## Container Architecture

### Custom PostgreSQL Container
- **Base**: `postgis/postgis:17-3.5` (PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS 3.5)
- **Python Environment**: Virtual environment with data processing packages
- **Custom Entrypoint**: Starts PostgreSQL, waits for readiness, runs initialization
- **Embedded Dependencies**: pandas, geopandas, pyarrow, psycopg2, sqlalchemy

### Volume Strategy
- **Database Persistence**: `postgres_data` volume (survives container restarts)
- **PGAdmin Configuration**: `pgadmin_data` volume (settings, connections)
- **Unified Data Location**: `./sql-scripts:/sql-scripts` (contains auto-downloaded data files)
- **Persistent Logging**: `./logs:/sql-scripts/logs` (organized by backfill configuration)
- **Script Access**: SQL scripts available both for initialization and PGAdmin queries

### Memory & Performance
- **Chunked Loading**: 10K rows per chunk prevents memory overflow
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time logging with execution time tracking
- **Optimized Indexes**: Spatial GIST, temporal, location, and composite indexes
- **Production Scale**: Handles millions of records efficiently based on backfill configuration
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Hash-based system prevents any duplicate rows across backfills

## Pause and Resume Capability

### Safe Interruption and Continuation
The system is designed to handle interruptions gracefully with automatic resume capability:

**Pause Processing:**
```bash
# Safely stop containers (preserves all data and progress)
docker-compose stop

# System can be safely interrupted at any point during backfill
```

**Resume Processing:**
```bash
# Automatically continues from where it left off
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor continuation progress
docker logs -f sql-playground-postgres
```

### Intelligent Resume System
When restarted, the system automatically:
- **üîç Detects Completed Months**: Checks `data_processing_log` table for already-processed data
- **‚è≠Ô∏è Skips Finished Data**: Already loaded months show as "Already processed (X records)"
- **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Continues From Interruption**: Resumes with the next unprocessed month
- **üõ°Ô∏è Prevents Duplicates**: Hash-based system prevents duplicate rows during resume
- **üìÅ Reuses Downloads**: Existing parquet files are reused, no re-downloading needed

### Example Resume Behavior
From logs (`logs/last_12_months/log_20250924_215426.log`):
```
üîÑ 2024-10: Already processed (3,833,769 records)  ‚úÖ Skipped
üîÑ 2024-11: Already processed (3,646,369 records)  ‚úÖ Skipped
üîÑ 2024-12: Already processed (3,668,371 records)  ‚úÖ Skipped
üîÑ 2025-01: Already processed (3,475,226 records)  ‚úÖ Skipped
‚ö†Ô∏è 2025-02: Previous processing incomplete, will retry  üîÑ Resumes here

üì• Loading yellow_tripdata_2025-02.parquet...
‚ö†Ô∏è Chunk 5/358 - 10000 duplicates skipped (hash-based)  üõ°Ô∏è Duplicate protection
‚ö†Ô∏è Chunk 10/358 - 10000 duplicates skipped (hash-based) üõ°Ô∏è Working as expected
```

The hash-based duplicate prevention ensures that even if processing was interrupted mid-file, no duplicate records are inserted when resuming.

## Configuration & Development

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
```env
# PostgreSQL Configuration
POSTGRES_DB=playground
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin123
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
